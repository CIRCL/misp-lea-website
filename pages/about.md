MISP-LEA project started the first June 2023. It consists in an law enforcement agency information sharing community. It's powered by [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/)[^1] and [AIL project](https://www.ail-project.org/)[^2], two leading open source projects led by [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/).

# Background

MISP, the leading open source project for threat intelligence and information sharing, is used by different actors in the cyber security field including CERTs/CSIRTs, SOCs and law enforcement agencies. MISP is used in different use-cases ranging from investigation, remediation, reporting and cross-border collaboration. Within this project a MISP instance is set up dedicated for law enforcement agencies. The instance is fed with threat intelligence data from CIRCL and Shadowserver. The intelligence provided includes threat intelligence from CSIRT/CERTs networks, OSINT networks, non-governmental organisations and other LEA. Training for law enforcement agencies is provided by CIRCL and Shadowserver.

# Who is behind?

The MISP instance is hosted during the project at CIRCL and hosting will be continued after the project at CIRCL in a global sustainability program for law enforcement MISP communities. The project will serve as ground for having an EU-based open source software stack for information sharing in law enforcement agencies. MISP-LEA provides an efficient open source tool along with the intelligence to support pre-investigation to enhance crime reporting. This project is carried out by [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/) and [SHADOWSERVER](https://www.shadowserver.org/). CIRCL is the coordinator.
