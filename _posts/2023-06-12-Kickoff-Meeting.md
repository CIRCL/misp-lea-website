On June 12th, 2023, the inaugural meeting for the MISP-LEA project was held. MISP-LEA, a collaborative endeavor between Shadowserver and CIRCL, is a 24-month initiative funded by the European Union. The project's central aim is to establish operational and enduring [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) and [AIL](https://www.ail-project.org/) instances dedicated specifically to law enforcement agencies. This setup will facilitate a smoother exchange of evidence between law enforcement agencies and improve the onset of collaborative investigations.

Law enforcement agencies willing to discover and leverage the MISP-LEA platform can apply on the [misp-lea.org website](/join).
